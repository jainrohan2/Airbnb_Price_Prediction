# Airbnb_Price_Prediction
ML model for prediction Airbnb prices

Introduction: This presentation offers a detailed overview of a comprehensive data analysis and regression modeling process applied to Airbnb listing data.

Tools Utilized: Python's powerful libraries such as Pandas and Scikit-learn were employed throughout the analysis.

Process Overview:

Data Preprocessing: The data underwent preprocessing to clean, format, and prepare it for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): EDA techniques were applied to gain insights into the dataset, uncover patterns, and identify potential variables affecting listing prices.
Feature Engineering: Various features were engineered or transformed to improve the predictive power of the models.
Regression Modeling: Multiple regression models were developed using Scikit-learn to predict Airbnb listing prices.
Model Evaluation: The performance of each model was evaluated using appropriate metrics to determine its effectiveness in predicting listing prices accurately.
Objective: The primary objective of this analysis is to showcase the application of data science techniques in real-world scenarios, particularly in optimizing Airbnb listing prices for improved market performance.

GitHub Repository: This presentation serves as documentation for the analysis conducted and can be found in the GitHub repository. It demonstrates the step-by-step process followed in analyzing Airbnb listing data and building regression models for price prediction.

Benefits: By following this analysis, users can gain valuable insights into the data science workflow for Airbnb pricing optimization, enabling them to apply similar techniques to their own datasets or real-world scenarios.
